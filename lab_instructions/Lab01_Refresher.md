## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Review a simple sample terraform deployment configuration file
- Deploy a local Docker image and container
- Test the container
- Modify the deployment
- Test the modified deployment
- Destroy the deployment

## Teaching Points

This lab introduces you to Terraform and guides you through using it to interact with locally installed Docker. It introduces providers, used to indicate the infrastructure that will be managed, and also the structure and composition of terraform files. You will review an example terraform file before initializing the client, planning, and then applying the deployment. You will then modify the deployment before eventually destroying it.

## Before you begin

1. Before you begin this lab ensure you have completed Lab 0.
2. On your remote virtual machine; start Docker desktop using the desktop shortcut and then use settings to ensure the docker service is listening on port 2375 without TLS.
3. Select **Close** and then exit settings using the lower X at top-right.
4. Verify no containers exist. Note: Your version of Docker Desktop may differ so the layout of this and subsequent docker command outputs may vary slightly.
5. Verify no local images exist.
6. Minimize Docker but keep it running in the background.

## Task1 Review the sample terraform configuration file

1. In the IDE, open `C:\aws-tf-int\labs\01\main.tf`.

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       docker = {
         source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
         version = "4.2.0"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "docker" {
     host = "tcp://localhost:2375"
   }

   # Pull the image
   resource "docker_image" "httpd" {
     name = "httpd:latest"
   }

   # Create a container
   resource "docker_container" "webserver" {
     image = docker_image.httpd.image_id
     name  = "webserver"
     ports {
       internal = 80
       external = 88
     }
   }
   ```

### Breaking It Down

#### Defining the Terraform Block

This is the terraform code block. It specifies the provider(s) required for the configuration, here it is Docker, indicating that we want to use Terraform to manage Docker resources. The source section, line 4, identifies the Docker provider component to be downloaded during initialization, and line 5, indicates which version is required.

#### Initializing the Provider

The provider block details parameters to be used when initializing the Docker provider. The configuration needed here is dependent upon the platform on which Docker is running. We are using Docker Desktop for Windows where the docker service is accessible using tcp port 2375.

#### Pulling the Docker Image

This is one of two blocks of code that indicate the resources we want Terraform to instruct Docker to create. Here we are defining a docker image that needs to be pulled from Docker hub. Line 16 identifies the image we want, the latest version of "httpd", an Apache webserver.

#### Creating the Docker Container

This is the second block of code that indicates the resources we want Terraform to instruct Docker to create. Here we are defining that we want docker to create a container called "web-server" (line 22) and we want it to be accessible using ports 80 and 88 (lines 24-25). A docker container is created from a docker image. Line 21 indicates that the image to be used to create this container is the one we ask Docker to pull from Docker hub in lines 15-17. This is an example of one resource code block referencing another and it also indicates to Terraform that it must wait for Docker to download the image before it can ask it to create the container using it. This is known as implicit dependency; the container depends upon the image existing.

## Task2 Run Terraform and Test

1. In your IDE terminal, ensure you are in the correct working directory (`C:\aws-tf-int\labs\01`) and then run the terraform initialization command:

   ```powershell
   terraform init
   ```

2. Run `terraform plan` and review what will be created:

   ```powershell
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Run `terraform apply` typing `yes` when prompted:

   ```powershell
   terraform apply
   ```

4. If prompted, Windows Defender should be configured to allow access.
5. Switch to Docker Desktop and verify the image download and container creation.
6. Switch back to the IDE terminal and run:

   ```powershell
   docker images
   ```

   This is the httpd image that Terraform instructed Docker to download. The 'U' indicates that it is currently in use.

7. Run `docker ps` to list running containers:

   ```powershell
   docker ps
   ```

   This is the container named 'webserver', that Terraform instructed Docker to start, using the downloaded image. Note the last few digits of the unique container ID for your running container (it will differ from the one shown here).

8. Use a new web browser tab within your virtual desktop to access the container using [http://127.0.0.1:88](http://127.0.0.1:88).
9. View the "It Works" response from the Apache web server (`index.html`).
10. We will now modify the deployment by changing the external port number from 88 to 8088. Some resource changes can be applied to the existing instance of a resource, whilst others require the destruction of the original resource and the creation of a replacement. Let us see whether a port change modifies or recreates this resource.
11. Return to the `main.tf` file and change the external port on line 25 to 8088:

    ```hcl
    ports {
      internal = 80
      external = 8088
    }
    ```

12. Run `terraform plan` again and review the changes. The change of port will force the current container to be deleted and a new one created:

    ```powershell
    terraform plan
    ```

13. Run `terraform apply`, typing `yes` when prompted:

    ```powershell
    terraform apply
    ```

14. Browse to [http://127.0.0.1:8088](http://127.0.0.1:8088). This should return a success "It works" showing that the new container is listening on port 8088.
15. Run `docker ps` again:

    ```powershell
    docker ps
    ```

    Note that your CONTAINER ID will have changed - Docker containers are immutable so Terraform destroyed the original container and deployed a replacement using the same image. This is an important point to be aware of as we progress through the course. Whether we 'update' or 'replace' a resource when making changes depends upon the resource itself and the changes we make.

## Task3 Examine the state file

1. When `terraform apply` is run for the first time, a persistent record of resources Terraform deploys and manages is created in the form of a state file, `terraform.tfstate`. This file is updated whenever you ask Terraform to create, change, or destroy resources thereafter. By default this file will be in your working directory. Click on it now to examine its contents.

## Task4 Destroy the deployment

1. Run `terraform destroy`, review the output and type `yes`:

   ```powershell
   terraform destroy
   ```

2. Run `docker ps` to confirm your container has been deleted:

   ```powershell
   docker ps
   ```

3. Run `docker images` and confirm your image has been deleted:

   ```powershell
   docker images
   ```

4. Revisit the state file and view its now reduced content.
5. Close the Docker Desktop window.

**Congratulations, you have completed this lab.**
